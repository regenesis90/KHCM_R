#' Saturated Traffic Flow Rate for Right Turns at Signalized Intersections
#'
#' Saturated traffic flow rate for right turns at signal intersections(pcphgpl).
#'     Although there are some differences depending on the radius of the right-turn curve,
#'     the general value of the saturated traffic flow rate
#'     in the free right-turn state at general intersections of urban roads is 1900 pcphgpl.
#'     It follows a definition in KHCM(2013), p.232.
