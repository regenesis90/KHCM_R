#'
#' Saturated traffic flow rate (pcphgpl, passenger car per hour of green per lane) under basic conditions in a two-point crossover diamond-shaped interchange (expressway connection road-general road junction). 2200 pcphgpl.
#'     The initial number of waiting vehicles for each display of the internal link is measured and used as an input value to calculate the additional loss time for green time.
#'     It follows a definition in KHCM(2013), p.427.
